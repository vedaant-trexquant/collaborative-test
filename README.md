# Toy problem: correlation

### Test data
To generate test data, run `./generate.py`.
This will create a file called vecs.mat, containing vectors for our program to find correlation in.
It will also create best.arr, containing indices of the selected vectors.

### Solver.cpp
The solver driver and timer.

### Corr.cpp
The self-correlation check implementation.
